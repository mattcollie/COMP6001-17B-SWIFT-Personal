# Personal Journal
This is a personal Journal for [COMP6001-17B-SWIFT](https://github.com/ToiOhomaiBCS/COMP6001-17B-SWIFT)

In this project I was assigned the role as the Team Leader, as the team leader I sought to create an organized structure we could work off.

## _Trello_
I createad a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/LyQqVv3z/comp6001-assesment-2) team and board to organize our progress for the report and as we continue for our application to record progress for where each team member is. 

## _Github_
I createad a [Github Repository](https://github.com/mattcollie/COMP6001-17B-SWIFT) to hold the report and in future the application we will be creating.

## _Wire-Frames_
On Thursday the 7th I gathered the group around my computer and drew up the wire-frames taking each persons input and producing the wire-frames for our application.
